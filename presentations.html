											Regions characterized with abundant surface water such as Western New York (WNY) may feel secure with the 
                      availability of water, but the quality or quantity of water can change due to future climate change and human 
                      activities. Assessments of these effects on water resources are needed. This research investigated future climate 
                      change and anthropogenic effects on water resources in WNY by developing an integrated surface water–groundwater 
                      model. The selected model, Ground-Water/ Surface-Water FLOW model (GSFLOW), quantified groundwater storage, since 
                      analyzing changes in storage can indicate how sensitive the watershed is to future environmental conditions. Under 
                      RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios, a regional climate model produced precipitation, solar radiation, and temperature 
                      outputs to simulate future climatic conditions. For future anthropogenic effects, three land development projections 
                      are considered: increased urbanization, increased agriculture, and current conditions. The GSFLOW model produced 
                      different simulations of future climate change and human activities effects on the hydrologic cycle by running all 
                      possible combinations of climatic and human scenarios. In addition to statistical analyses, the basin-scale modeling 
                      approach attributed climatic and human effects on storage and quantified the temporal and spatial variability of 
                      storage. This study demonstrated the value in creating a regional model in a humid, surface water-dependent area 
                      like WNY. Through sensitivity analyses, the model enabled the determination of hydrologic drivers of the system 
                      that contribute to storage. Modeling results suggest that groundwater storage will have a bigger role affecting 
                      surface water and surface water -groundwater interactions. With increased extreme precipitation events, groundwater 
                      storage will help delay the peak flow effects on streams and potentially mitigate flooding events. Distinguishing 
                      the individual, collective, and temporal effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities, with detailed 
                      variability, is imperative for proper management of water resources in WNY.

											Municipal wells in Waterville, New York started showing abnormally high levels of sodium and chloride 
                      sometime after the completion of the wells twenty years ago. Based on earlier studies, we believe that 
                      an uncovered road salt storage area located two km upgradient from the wells is the source of the salt. 
                      A stream that flows between the salt source and the wells should act as a hydraulic barrier to salt transport 
                      in shallow groundwater. However, some reaches of the stream dry up during especially dry summer months. 
                      Increased pumping of the municipal wells during these periods may exacerbate the problem by inducing infiltration 
                      from the stream. During these times, the stream may no longer act as a barrier to groundwater flow, and salty 
                      groundwater flows to the wells.

											We are currently measuring vertical streambed temperature profiles to quantify flux through the streambed and 
                      to evaluate temporal changes in flux due to pumping. This will help us evaluate how changes from gaining to losing 
                      in critical reaches affect salt distribution and movement in the aquifer. Results from earlier studies using 
                      vertical head gradients from minipiezometers show that reaches of the stream near the wells appear to be losing. 
                      But these data were snapshots and cannot be correlated with pumping history. Preliminary results from the temperature 
                      profile measurements show that when the municipal wells are pumped, there is a greater downward flux under the stream. 
                      In addition, conductivity values in monitoring wells appear to increase after pumping periods. When combined with the 
                      results of the earlier studies, the results of this work will help us determine when and where the salt travels beneath 
                      the stream to reach the municipal wells.

											Nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, negatively affect Lake Erie’s water quality thus impacting humans 
                      and aquatic organisms. The environmental impacts are clearly articulated at an international level in the State of 
                      the Great Lakes 2017 Report released by the U.S. and Canadian governments. While the EPA currently focuses on 
                      monitoring Lake Erie tributaries as a significant source of nutrient flux, this research expands the scope to track 
                      nutrient fluxes from both groundwater and surface water at Woodlawn Beach State Park on the eastern shore of Lake 
                      Erie. The Woodlawn Beach complex consists of two tributaries streams and a coastal wetland that flow into Lake Erie. 
                      This field site was instrumented with stream gages and an array of nested groundwater wells that were monitored 
                      during the summer of 2017. Bi-weekly water samples were collected from four surface waters and ten groundwater wells 
                      to test for phosphorus and nitrogen in several forms (i.e. dissolved reactive phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonia). 
                      Stream stage and discharge were measured to produce rating curves to calculate stream discharge into the lake. 
                      Nutrient fluxes from groundwater and surface waters entering Lake Erie at Woodlawn Beach were calculated and compared 
                      during the spring to summer 2017 field season. Results show ammonia as being one of the greatest contributors of 
                      nutrient flux into the lake, especially in groundwater. While these results not only highlight the importance of 
                      analyzing groundwater in conjunction with surface water when dealing with nutrient flux, they also may indicate a 
                      reducing environment potentially caused by urban waste water leakage that could pose probable threats to living 
                      organisms.

											Lake Erie’s degrading water quality has become an issue of concern due to excess amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. 
                      The U.S. and Canadian governments released the State of the Great Lakes 2017 Report stating that Lake Erie’s status of nutrients is poor. 
                      As a result, the federal government is putting efforts to monitor the main tributaries entering Lake Erie to determine the major sources 
                      of nutrient flux. This research contributes to the federal government’s monitoring goals and expands on current studies by examining both 
                      groundwater and surface water as potential sources of nutrient fluxes at Woodlawn Beach State Park, located on the eastern shore of Lake 
                      Erie. With two tributaries and a wetland that flow into the lake, Woodlawn Beach was an ideal field site to install stream gages and 
                      nested groundwater wells. Four surface waters and ten groundwater wells were sampled bi-weekly during the spring to summer 2017 field 
                      season to test for nitrogen, phosphorus, and its constituents (i.e. total phosphorus, nitrite, and total nitrogen). Stream discharge 
                      into the lake was calculated using rating curves that plot observed stream stage versus discharge. Comparing nutrient fluxes from 
                      groundwater and surface waters showed that ammonia was a major contributor of groundwater nutrient flux into the lake while surface 
                      water nutrient fluxes were much lower. These results emphasize the importance of expanding research to consider groundwater nutrient 
                      flux in addition to surface water nutrient flux. Further analysis is needed to find the source of ammonia before it becomes detrimental 
                      to the health of humans and organisms alike.
